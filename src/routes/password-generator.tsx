                answer:
                  "Yes. Passwords are generated entirely within your browser using the Web Crypto API, which provides cryptographically strong random values. Your password is never sent to any server."

                question: "Why should I use a generated password?",
                answer:
                  "Humans are predictable and often choose patterns that are easy for computers to guess (like 'Password123'). A randomly generated password with a mix of characters is mathematically much harder to crack."
              },
              {
                question: "What makes a password strong?",
                answer:
                  "A strong password is long (12+ characters) and includes a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. This maximizes the number of possible combinations, increasing security."
