    question: "Will I lose image quality when resizing?",
    answer: "Resizing to larger dimensions may reduce quality, but our tool uses high-quality algorithms to minimize degradation. When resizing to smaller dimensions, quality loss is minimal. You can control the output quality using the quality slider."
  },
  {
    question: "What formats are supported?",
    answer: "We support all major image formats including JPG, PNG, WebP, GIF, BMP, and more. You can also convert between formats during the resize process."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I batch resize multiple images?",
    answer: "Yes! You can upload multiple images and they will all be resized to the same dimensions. Each image will be downloaded individually after processing."
  },
  {
    question: "What does 'maintain aspect ratio' mean?",
    answer: "When enabled, the tool will automatically calculate the height or width to preserve the original proportions of your image. This prevents distortion and stretching. For example, a 1920×1080 image resized to 1280px wide will automatically become 1280×720."
