# Toolbox

A collection of free, open-source tools for developers and creatives, built with privacy and simplicity in mind.

## 🚀 Why this exists?

I've always wondered: **Why should I give my data to large corporations just to perform simple tasks?**

Whether it's converting a file, compressing an image, or formatting code, there's no reason your data needs to leave your device. Many online tools upload your files to their servers, which poses potential privacy risks.

**Toolbox is different.** It is designed to run entirely in your browser.

- **100% Offline Capable**: Works without an internet connection after loading.
- **Privacy First**: Your files **never** leave your device. No uploads, no tracking.
- **Open Source**: The code is open for anyone to inspect.

## 🛠️ Architecture

This project is built as a modern web application focusing on client-side processing.

- **Monorepo**: Managed with `pnpm` workspaces for efficient dependency handling across apps and packages.
- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for a robust and performant React-based architecture.
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for utility-first styling.
- **UI Components**: Built with [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for a reliable and accessible design system.
- **Client-Side Logic**: Heavy use of Web APIs and client-side libraries (like `pdf.js`, canvas API) to handle file processing directly in the browser.

## 🤖 AI Transparency

Some parts of this codebase were generated with the assistance of AI tools to accelerate development. However, **every line of code has been reviewed, tested, and approved by me** to ensure security, performance, and correctness.

## 🔮 Future & Funding

Currently, this project is a labor of love. In the future, to keep the site running and free:

- I might introduce non-intrusive advertisements.
- I may open up sponsorship opportunities for those who find these tools valuable.

Regardless of funding, the core promise remains: **Your data stays yours.**
